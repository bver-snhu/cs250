# Interpreting the needs of a user is done through communication. First, one needs to understand what the user is actually looking to do and why.
# This information can be obtained by having face to face meetings where one asks the user what sort of functionality and requirements they want
# and for what reason. Taking this information, one can start to create user stories to break this functionality/requirements down to manageable
# pieces that can then be added to the backlog and worked on by the team during upcoming Sprints. The user stories help the team understand what 
# they're trying to accomplish for the user and why.
#
# This course has given me knew ways to approach project planning and execution. Moving forward, I'll be using more organized methods to work
# with the key stakeholders of the project to understand their needs. I'll put these needs into the form of user stories so that I'll have
# a better understanding on what needs to get done. I'll use a Sprint Planning event to decided what can be accomplished in the following determined
# timeline, and then work with whoever is involved to keep everyone updated and try to keep the process as efficient as possible on a daily basis.
# After the project gets completed, I'll present to the stakeholders for their approval and sign off. Finally, I review what went well and could have
# been better during the previous work effort so that future endeavors can go more smoothly. This process incorporates all the main agile events,
# which I think can improve on how I plan and execute on my future projects.

# Being a good team member in software development, to me, entails a few different things. Being on a team means that one's actions should not solely
# be for the benefit of just themselves, but also take into account those they're working alongside. This means bringing a positive mentality to
# the work environment and looking for ways to help the other members of the team be successful. This also means holding ourselves accountable for 
# our actions. Being a good team member means being reliable and dependable on getting the work done that was agreed upon. Not only does this 
# include getting the work actually finished, but also being able to reach out for assistance when stuck on certain challenges so that one doesn't 
# fall behind and hold the rest of the team up. Keeping these things in mind helps build up the entire team and not only makes sure projects get done,
# but that they're not unpleasant experiences either.
